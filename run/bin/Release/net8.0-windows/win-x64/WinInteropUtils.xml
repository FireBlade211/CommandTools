             <param name="coInit">The concurrency model and initialization options for the thread. Any combination of values from <see cref="T:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit"/> can be used, except
             that the <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit.ApartmentThreaded"/> and <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit.MultiThreaded"/> flags cannot both be set.
             The default is <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit.MultiThreaded"/>.</param>

             <remarks>
             <para><see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/> must be called at least once, and is usually called only once, for each thread that uses the COM library. Multiple calls
             to <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/> by the same thread are allowed as long as they pass the same concurrency flag, but subsequent valid calls return
             <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.HRESULT.S_FALSE"/>. If the concurrency flag does not match, then the call fails and returns <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.HRESULT.RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE"/>. 
             (For the purpose of this rule, a call to CoInitialize is equivalent to calling <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/> with the <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit.ApartmentThreaded"/> flag.) To
             uninitialize the COM library gracefully on a thread, each successful call to CoInitialize or <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/>, including any call that
             returns <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.HRESULT.S_FALSE"/>, must be balanced by a corresponding call to <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoUninitialize"/>. Once COM has been uninitialized on a thread,
             you can reinitialize it in any mode, subject to the constraints above.</para>
            
             <para>You need to initialize the COM library on a thread before you call any of the library functions except CoGetMalloc, to get
             a pointer to the standard allocator, and the memory allocation functions. Otherwise, the COM function will return <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.HRESULT.CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED"/>.</para>
            
             <para>Objects created in a single-threaded apartment (STA) receive method calls only from their apartment's thread, so calls are serialized and arrive
             only at message-queue boundaries (when the PeekMessage or SendMessage function is called).</para>
            
             <para>Objects created on a COM thread in a multithread apartment (MTA) must be able to receive method calls from other threads at any time. You
             would typically implement some form of concurrency control in a multithreaded object's code using synchronization primitives such as critical sections,
             semaphores, or mutexes to help protect the object's data.</para>
            
             <para>When an object that is configured to run in the neutral threaded apartment (NTA) is called by a thread that is in either
             an STA or the MTA, that thread transfers to the NTA. If this thread subsequently calls <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/>, the call fails and returns
             <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.HRESULT.RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE"/>.</para>
            
             <para>Because OLE technologies are not thread-safe, the OleInitialize function calls <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/> with the <see cref="F:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit.ApartmentThreaded"/> flag. As a result,
             an apartment that is initialized for multithreaded object concurrency cannot use the features enabled by OleInitialize.</para>
            
             Because there is no way to control the order in which in-process servers are loaded or unloaded, do not call CoInitialize, <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/>,
             or <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoUninitialize"/> from the <c>DllMain</c> function.

             <remarks>
             <para>A thread must call <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoUninitialize"/> once for each successful call it has made to the CoInitialize or <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/> function,

             can close it.</para>
            
             <para>Calls to OleInitialize must be balanced by calls to OleUninitialize. The OleUninitialize function calls <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoUninitialize"/> internally, so applications
             that call OleUninitialize do not also need to call <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoUninitialize"/>.</para>
            
            
             <para><see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoUninitialize"/> should be called on application shutdown, as the last call made to the COM library after the application hides
             its main windows and falls through its main message loop. If there are open conversations remaining, <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoUninitialize"/>
             starts a modal message loop and dispatches any pending messages from the containers or server for this COM application.
             By dispatching the messages, <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoUninitialize"/> ensures that the application does not quit before receiving all of its pending messages.
             Non-COM messages are discarded.</para>
            
            
             Because there is no way to control the order in which in-process servers are loaded or unloaded, do not call CoInitialize, <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/>,

             Specifies flags for <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/>.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             <para>When a thread is initialized through a call to <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInitializeEx(FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit)"/>, you choose whether to initialize it as apartment-threaded or
             multithreaded by designating one of the members of <see cref="T:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.COM.CoInit"/> as its parameter. This designates how incoming calls to any object created by that
             thread are handled, that is, the object's concurrency.</para>
            
             <para>Apartment-threading, while allowing for multiple threads of execution, serializes all incoming calls by requiring that calls to methods
             of objects created by this thread always run on the same thread, i.e. the apartment/thread that created them. In addition, calls can arrive only at message-queue
             boundaries. Because of this serialization, it is not typically necessary to write concurrency control into the code for the object, other than to avoid calls
             to <see href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-peekmessagea">PeekMessage</see> and
             <see cref="M:FireBlade.WinInteropUtils.User32.SendMessage(System.IntPtr,System.UInt32,System.UIntPtr,System.IntPtr)"/> during processing that must not be interrupted by other method invocations or calls to other 
             objects in the same apartment/thread.</para>
            
             <para>Multi-threading (also called free-threading) allows calls to methods of objects created by this thread to be run on any thread. There is no
             serialization of calls, i.e. many calls may occur to the same method or to the same object or simultaneously. Multi-threaded object concurrency offers the
             highest performance and takes the best advantage of multiprocessor hardware for cross-thread, cross-process, and cross-machine calling,
             since calls to objects are not serialized in any way.This means, however, that the code for objects must enforce its own concurrency model, typically through
             the use of synchronization primitives, such as critical sections, semaphores, or mutexes. In addition, because the object doesn't control the lifetime
             of the threads that are accessing it, no thread-specific state may be stored in the object
             (in <see href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/ProcThread/thread-local-storage">Thread Local Storage</see>).</para>
            
            
             <i>Note: The multi-threaded apartment is intended for use by non-GUI threads. Threads in multi-threaded apartments should not perform UI actions.
             This is because UI threads require a message pump, and COM does not pump messages for threads in a multi-threaded apartment.</i>
